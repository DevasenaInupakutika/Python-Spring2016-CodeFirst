<h1 id="building-web-applications-with-django">Building web applications with Django</h1>
<p>Django is a powerful, popular web framework for Python to help you build complex web applications quickly. This framework does the repetitive work for us, allowing us to get a working website up quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Django has got very thorough and readable docs available online. It’s not a content management system. It’s a web framework. It is designed to work in a slightly modified Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It is a software engineering architecture concept describing how a program can change the visual aspect and the business aspect without affecting one another. It is referred to as model, template and view framework (MTV) by original Django developers. The <code>View</code> refers to the data presented to the user. Not <em>how</em> data looks, but <em>which</em> data. <em>The view describes which data you see, not how you see it.</em></p>
<p>It leaves the <em>how</em> to an additional element found in Django: the template.</p>
<p>Django was designed to make web development fast, easy and fun. It’s entirely self-contained for development purposes. It includes a CLI, a web server and everything you need to get up and running without installing anything other than Django.</p>
<p>The web server included with Django is not intended to be used in a production environment. The preferred method is to run Django through <em>mod_python</em> or <em>mod_wsgi</em>. In this session, let’s look at how we might go about building a Django application.</p>
<p>As an example, here’s a very high-level overview of how a Django app is built:</p>
