## Using Python to scrape website data

We can make story with data. It can be the pime element of an investigation, and it can lead to new insights and new ways of thinking. 

Unfortunately, the *data* we mostly want is not always available in the required form always. It is not always available in packaged form and 
easily and directly downloaded. In such cases, a technique used to programmatically gather the data for us called **web scraping** can be used.

In this session, we'll go through how to use *Python* to perform this task. In this process, we will also see some basics of how web pages work 
and how data is structured.
