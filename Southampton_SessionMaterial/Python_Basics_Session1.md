## Introducing Python

Python is a powerful, fast, open-source & easy to learn programming language - Python is ideal for first time programmers.
Pythonâ€™s design philosophy has an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

The core philosophy of the language is summarized by [PEP 20(The Zen of Python)](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020), which includes aphorisms such as:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

In this course, we will be learning the basics of Python, in a **scientific data analysis**, **web scraping**  and **web development** contexts. For web development, we will be using a very simple web framework by the name of [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), which is 
very light weight and easy to use.

## pip

pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. We will be using pip to install things like Flask and any other dependencies we want to make use of. You should already have pip installed as per the course preparatory work.
