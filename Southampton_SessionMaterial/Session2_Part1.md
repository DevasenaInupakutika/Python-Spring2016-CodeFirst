## Processing Data

## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
*   Write a script to open a data file and print out its contents.
*   Perform some operations on strings to extract desired data from it.
*   Understand the basics of how Python handles objects.

So far we've seen how to use and manipulate variables, and how to use loops in a script to process strings.
But let's take a look at a more interesting use case - performing some operations on the data in our CSV data file.

We'll start out by looking at how to read the data file and print
its contents in a script, and then modify our script to perform
some conversions and output that. Along the way, we'll see how we can make our code more understandable to 
others (as well as ourselves, when we might come back to it at a later date).

## Printing contents of a data file

We first need to be able to read in our `Annual mean temperature records 1910-2014` data picked from *Scottish Environment Statistics Online - National Climate Information Centre (Met Office)*.
