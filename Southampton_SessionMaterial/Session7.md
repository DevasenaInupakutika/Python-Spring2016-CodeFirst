# Building web applications with Django

Django is a powerful, popular web framework for Python to help you build complex web applications quickly. 
This framework does the repetitive work for us, allowing us to get a working website up quickly and easily. 

Django has got very thorough and readable docs available online. It's not a content management system. It's a web framework. It is designed to work in a slightly modified Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It is a software engineering architecture concept describing how a program can change the visual aspect and the business aspect without affecting one another. It is referred to as model, template and view framework (MTV) by original Django developers. The `View` refers to the data presented to the user. Not *how* data looks, but *which* data. *The view describes which data you see, not how you see it.* 

It leaves the *how* to an additional element found in Django: the template. 

Django was designed to make web development fast, easy and fun. It's entirely self-contained for development purposes. It includes a CLI, a web server and everything you need to get up and running without installing anything other than Django. 

The web server included with Django is not intended to be used in a production environment. The preferred method is to run Django through *mod_python* or *mod_wsgi*. In this session, let's look at how we might go about building a Django application. 

As an example, here's a very high-level overview of how a Django app is built: 

1. Our first step is to grab a copy of Django and set up a development environment where we can tinker away.
