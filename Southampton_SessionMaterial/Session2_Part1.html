<h2 id="learning-objectives" class="objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a script to open a data file and print out its contents.</li>
<li>Perform some operations on strings to extract desired data from it.</li>
<li>Understand the basics of how Python handles objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far we’ve seen how to use and manipulate variables, and how to use loops in a script to process strings. But let’s take a look at a more interesting use case - performing some operations on the data in our CSV data file.</p>
<p>We’ll start out by looking at how to read the data file and print its contents in a script, and then modify our script to perform some conversions and output that. Along the way, we’ll see how we can make our code more understandable to others (as well as ourselves, when we might come back to it at a later date).</p>
<h2 id="printing-contents-of-a-data-file">Printing contents of a data file</h2>
<p>We first need to be able to read in our <code>Annual mean temperature records 1910-2014</code> data picked from <em>Scottish Environment Statistics Online - National Climate Information Centre (Met Office)</em>. The data is present in file <code>CCtemperature.csv</code>. We will be reading our data from this file, and using a loop, print out each line. Let’s write another script called <code>temp_analysis.py</code>, and enter the following:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">temp_data = <span class="dt">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;../data/CCtemperature.csv&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;r&#39;</span>)

<span class="kw">for</span> line in temp_data:
    <span class="dt">print</span>(line)</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>open</code>, we first specify the file we wish to open, and then include how we want to use that file. If we wanted to open a file to write to, we would use ‘w’, but in this case, we specify <code>r</code> for reading.</p>
<p>In general, we know that a loop will iterate over a collection and set a loop variable to be each item in that collection. When Python deals with files, it does something quite helpful in a loop. By specifying <code>climate_data</code> as our collection, it reads in a single line at a time from our data file, assigning it to our <code>line</code> loop control variable.</p>
<p>We can run our code with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">python</span> temp_analysis.py</code></pre>
<p>And we get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>Year,Average surface temperature (degrees Celsius),Differences from 1961-1990 average (degrees Celsius)

<p>Hmmm… but that’s not really perfect, since it’s also printing out additional newlines which exist at the end of each line in our data file. We can remove them by stripping them out, using <code>rstrip</code>, a function that works on strings. We can use it like:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">    <span class="dt">print</span>(line.rstrip())</code></pre>
<h2 id="python-and-object-orientation---in-a-nutshell" class="callout">Python and object orientation - in a nutshell</h2>
<p>So far we’ve used strings, which are a type of object in Python. In general, an object is an instance of something called a class.</p>
<p>A class defines how a certain thing can behave, and an object is then a particular thing that behaves the way its class tells it to. You can define classes that include properties (like variables, associated with that class), and methods (like functions, also associated with that class and can perform operations on them). We can use classes to define things in the real world.</p>
<p>For example, a car is made up of things like an engine, wheels, windows, and so forth - these things could be defined as classes. And for each of these, they would have their own properties and methods. A wheel class for example, could have diameter and width as properties, and a window could have size, tint and shape and properties, and assuming it’s an electric window, it could have up() and down() as methods to raise and lower the window. A class can have as many properties and methods as we choose to define for it.</p>
<p>When we define a particular car, we could say it has a single engine, four wheels and four windows. Each of these would be an object — an instance of its class — each with its own set of properties, which could all be different. We’re taking advantage of the fact that all four windows and all four wheels will behave the same way, but individually. Using the down() method on one of the windows would cause that window to lower, but only that window.</p>
<p>So, in our example, <code>line</code> is a String object, an instance of a String class. And that String class has a defined method called <code>rstrip()</code>, which removes the trailing newline. There are many other String methods which are incredibly useful!</p>
<p>So, let’s try that out:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">temp_data = <span class="dt">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;../data/CCtemperature.csv&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;r&#39;</span>)

<span class="kw">for</span> line in temp_data:
    <span class="dt">print</span>(line.rstrip())</code></pre>
<p>And now we get:</p>
