<h2 id="using-python-to-scrape-website-data">Using Python to scrape website data</h2>
<p>We can make story with data. It can be the pime element of an investigation, and it can lead to new insights and new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <em>data</em> we mostly want is not always available in the required form always. It is not always available in packaged form and easily and directly downloaded. In such cases, a technique used to programmatically gather the data for us called <strong>web scraping</strong> can be used.</p>
<p>In this session, weâ€™ll go through how to use <em>Python</em> to perform this task. In this process, we will also see some basics of how web pages work and how data is structured.</p>
